There was a girl named Grace. 
She lived in a small house with 3 dogs and 2 cats.
She loves to watch the star and moon at night. 
Also, she enjoyed sunlight in the morning with a cup of tea.
One day she met a friend.
And they live happily ever after.

One day, streaking like the blast of a musket over the formerly clear sky, a great thunderstorm came. Grace and her friend were terrified, but there was hope yet! If only they could find it...
