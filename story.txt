There was a girl named Grace. 
She lived in a small house with 3 dogs and 2 cats.
She loves to watch the star and moon at night. 
Also, she enjoyed sunlight in the morning with a cup of tea.
One day she met a friend.
And they live happily ever after.

Except for the fact that they didn't! Struggle and strife are always but seconds away, and they, with all the force of inevitability, struck down on Grace and her friend's tranquility. One day, streaking like the blast of a musket over the formerly clear sky, a great thunderstorm came. Grace and her friend were terrified, but there was hope yet! If only they could find it...

While the storm was roaring, Grace and her friend were scared inside of her house. Grace came up with a brilliant idea, why not dress up the pets and have a animal fashion show to calm their nerves. Her friend, who loved the idea, ran off and grabbed the clothes they had for the animals and some lights. While she was gone, Grace set up a little runway and treats to lure the animals down it. Once her friend came back, the show started! First up? The dogs!
